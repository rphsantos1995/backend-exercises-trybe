 Here is compiled all backend exercises from trybe course

The main purpose of this docs is to create an overview about some basic backend knowledge, recap its chapters and hopefully help people clarify some questions.

# Sql Introduction

## What's SQL?

SQL is the language used to create, search, extract and also manipulate data within a relational database. To make this possible, there are commands such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT and WHERE, among others.

## Database types

##### Sql

- predefined tables
- no dynamic alterations in structure
- relation between tables

##### NoSql

- predefined structures are not mandatory
- has dynamic alterations in structure
- no oficial language

## What's constraints?

Rules and restrictions to manipulate data in SQL tables
See more at: [https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_constraints.asp](w3School)

Types of constraints:

- NOT NULL 

Ensures that field cannot contain null values

- UNIQUE 

Ensures that the value entered in the table  column is unique

- PRIMARY KEY 

A table's primary key ensures that the column this constraint is being applied to is the table's unique identifier.

- FOREIGN KEY

A table's foreign key references a primary key (value in a column with the PRIMARY KEY constraint) of another table, allowing a relationship between the two.

- DEFAULT

Ensures that if no value is entered in the column (or if the user enters a null value)

Snipet example bellow:

```sql  
DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS ProductStore;
CREATE SCHEMA ProductStore;

CREATE TABLE ProductStore.Users (
  id INTEGER AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  username TEXT NOT NULL,
  classe TEXT NOT NULL,
  level INTEGER NOT NULL,
  password TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE ProductStore.Orders (
  id INTEGER AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  userId INTEGER,
  FOREIGN KEY (userId) REFERENCES ProductStore.Users (id)
);

CREATE TABLE ProductStore.Products (
  id INTEGER AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  amount TEXT NOT NULL,
  orderId INTEGER,
  FOREIGN KEY (orderId) REFERENCES ProductStore.Orders (id)
);
```
## What's a entity?

Uma tabela que representa algum conceito do mundo real que você quer descrever (pessoa, eventos, acontecimentos) e suas propriedades (altura, horário do evento, nome do acontecimento). A entidade pessoa , por exemplo, pode ter as propriedades de altura, peso e idade. Uma entidade festa pode possuir as propriedades horário do evento, público-alvo e data da festa. Por fim, uma entidade venda pode possuir as propriedades valor da venda, dia da venda, produto vendido etc.
- Entidade : Pessoa
- Propriedades : Altura, peso, idade.

## Database relationships

- One to One Relationship (1:1): 
It is used to create a relationship between two tables in which a single row of the first table can only be related to one and only one records of a second table. Similarly, the row of a second table can also be related to anyone row of the first table.

- One to Many Relationship: 
It is used to create a relationship between two tables. Any single rows of the first table can be related to one or more rows of the second tables, but the rows of second tables can only relate to the only row in the first table. It is also known as a many to one relationship.

- Many to Many Relationship: 
It is many to many relationships that create a relationship between two tables. Each record of the first table can relate to any records (or no records) in the second table. Similarly, each record of the second table can also relate to more than one record of the first table. It is also represented an N:N relationship.

## Database manipulation

On conditional update and deletion, you can pass a 'where id <> 0' parameter to bypass the safe updates mode

```sql
UPDATE sakila.staff
SET first_name = 'Rannveig'
WHERE first_name = 'Ravein'
and id <> 0;
```

```sql
DELETE FROM sakila.film_text
WHERE title = 'ACADEMY DINOSAUR'
and id <> 0;
```

- Bulk UPDATE

For performance reasons, so that only one query request is sent to the server, we can do a bulk update.

Fix condition list
```sql
UPDATE sakila.actor
SET first_name = 'JOE'
WHERE actor_id IN (1,2,3); -- condition list
```

Update each item individually
```sql
UPDATE sakila.actor
SET first_name = (
CASE actor_id WHEN 1 THEN 'JOE' 
              WHEN 2 THEN 'DAVIS' 
              WHEN 3 THEN 'CAROLINE' 
          ELSE first_name  
END);
```
You can also set the safe_update to 0 for update and deletion without a where condition(key/value pair).

```sql
SET sql_safe_updates=1, sql_select_limit=1000, max_join_size=1000000;
```
